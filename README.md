# WatIsHelp

## Objective
Make a app that allows users to randomly chat with other people. User will sign up to be *Helpers* or *Searchers*. A Searcher will open the app and indicate that they would like to talk to a Helper. A Helper will be selected randomly from a pool of users that have opted in and would like to help out a Searcher. The app will notify the Helper and then the Helper must accept before the chat will begin. Then the Helpers will provide moral support in whatever issues the Searcher wants to talk about.

## Goals
- user-moderated (Searches rate Helpers)
- anonymous (username based only)
- some sort of reward system for Helpers (maybe avatar customization or something?)
- quick matching process

## Other Details
This app is intended only for University of Waterloo students at the moment.
